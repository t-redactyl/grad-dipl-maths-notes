### Chapter 2

* $\neg P$ : The negation of $P$
* $P \wedge Q$: The conjunction of $P$ and $Q$, or "$P$ and $Q$"
* $P \vee Q$: The disjunction of $P$ and $Q$, or "$P$ or $Q$"
* $P \Rightarrow Q$: $P$ implies $Q$, or "if $P$, then $Q$"
* $P \iff Q$: $P$ is equivalent to $Q$, $P$ if and only if (iff) $Q$  
* $A = \{1,2,3\}$: The set $A$ consists of the numbers 1, 2 and 3
* $A$ = $\{n | n$ is a whole number and $1 \leq n \leq 3 \}$: The set $A$ consists of the numbers 1, 2 and 3
* $x \in A$: $x$ belongs to the set $A$ 
* $x \notin A$: $x$ does not belong to the set $A$
* $\mathbb{N}$ : natural numbers (or all positive integers)
* $\emptyset$: the empty set
* $S \subseteq T$ or $S \subset T$: $S$ is the subset of $T$ (that is, all of the members of the set $S$ are also members of the set $T$) 
* $A \cup B$: the union of $A$ and $B$ - that is, those members who belong to set $A$, set $B$ or both
* $A \cap B$: the intersection of $A$ and $B$ - that is, those members who belong to both set $A$ and set $B$
* $E$ \ $A$, $\bar A$ or $A^c$: the complement of subset $A$ of the universal set $E$

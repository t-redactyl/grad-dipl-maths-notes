## Part 2: Chapters 8-14

## Chapter 8: rational, real and complex numbers

**Construction of rational numbers using equivalence relations:** Let $X = \mathbb{Z} \times (\mathbb{Z} \backslash [0])$ be all pairs ($m,n$) where $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $n \neq 0$, and define a relation $R$ on $X$ where: 
$$
(m,n)R(m', n') \iff mn' = m'n
$$
(This is another way of saying that $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{m'}{n'}$, without yet getting into fractions.) This relation is an equivalence class because:
